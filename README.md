# Automated Attendance System Using Facial Recognition

This repository contains a notebook that trains a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) for facial recognition, aiming to develop an automated attendance system. The project explores deep learning techniques for face verification and demonstrates a practical approach to attendance tracking using facial recognition.

## Project Overview

Traditional attendance methods are often inefficient, error-prone, and susceptible to cheating. This project investigates facial recognition as a solution to automate attendance in classrooms and institutions.

- **Initial Approach:** Training a Siamese Neural Network from scratch using a custom dataset combined with Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW).  
- **Challenges:** Despite enhancements like using a pre-trained ResNet50 backbone and advanced training techniques, the model struggled to generalize to unseen faces in real-world conditions due to limited dataset diversity and computational constraints.  
- **Final Approach:** Adoption of a pre-trained FaceNet model paired with MTCNN for face detection, significantly improving accuracy and real-time performance for attendance tracking.

## Key Features

- Custom dataset creation combining own captured images and LFW dataset
- Siamese network architecture using a pre-trained ResNet50 as the base feature extractor
- Enhanced training techniques: Batch Normalization, LeakyReLU, Dropout, ReduceLROnPlateau
- Implementation of L2 normalization and distance layers for similarity learning
- Performance evaluation and comparison on real and unseen face images

## Limitations & Lessons Learned

- The trained Siamese Neural Network struggled to generalize to diverse and unseen faces, especially under varying lighting and pose conditions.
- Computational resource constraints limited dataset size and model complexity.
- These challenges motivated switching to a more robust pre-trained FaceNet model, which yielded superior results for the attendance system.
